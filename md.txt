## Project: Binance P2P Anomaly Detector Web Dashboard

**Goal:**
- Build a lightweight Web Dashboard that:
  - Repeatedly fetches Spot prices of USDT/BTC/ETH from Binance Exchange.
  - Simultaneously fetches P2P advertisements (Buy/Sell) from Binance P2P API.
  - Calculates percentage difference between P2P price and Spot price.
  - Detects anomalies based on a configurable threshold (e.g., ±0.5%).
  - Displays detected anomalies in a clean, real-time updating dashboard.
  - No Telegram or external alerts needed; focus on clear dashboard display only.

**Backend (Node.js or Python):**
- Task scheduler (e.g., every 5 seconds):
  - Fetch Spot price: `GET https://api.binance.com/api/v3/ticker/price`
  - Fetch P2P ads: `POST https://p2p.binance.com/bapi/c2c/v2/friendly/c2c/adv/search`
- Analyze:
  - Calculate % deviation = (P2P price – Spot price) / Spot price × 100%
  - If deviation exceeds threshold → mark as "Anomaly".

**Frontend (React or simple HTML+JS):**
- Display table with columns:
  - Merchant Name
  - Order Count
  - Completion Rate
  - Trade Type (Buy/Sell)
  - P2P Price
  - Spot Price
  - % Deviation
  - Timestamp
- Color-code anomalies:
  - Green for good buying opportunity (Sell price much lower).
  - Red for good selling opportunity (Buy price much higher).
- Auto-refresh the table as new data arrives (preferably using WebSocket or periodic polling).

**Extra Features (Optional):**
- Configurable threshold (input field to set % deviation trigger).
- Filter by payment method or fiat currency.
- Sort anomalies by severity of % deviation.

**Important Notes:**
- Prioritize real-time responsiveness and lightweight design.
- Ensure API call frequency respects Binance limits (no abuse).
- Use simple and efficient technology stack (minimal dependencies).
